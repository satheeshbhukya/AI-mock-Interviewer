    "**The Problem: The High Stakes and Limitations of Traditional Technical Interview Practice**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing for technical interviews in the competitive tech industry is a critical yet often inefficient and stressful process. Candidates frequently encounter limitations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of Realistic Simulation: Existing resources often fail to replicate the dynamic, conversational nature and pressure of a real technical interview.\n",
    "* Subjective and Delayed Feedback: Feedback from human mock interviews can be subjective, inconsistent, and often comes with delays, hindering rapid learning.\n",
    "* Limited Accessibility and Scalability: Access to experienced human interviewers for practice is often restricted by cost and availability.\n",
    "Difficulty in Identifying Specific Weaknesses: Candidates may struggle to pinpoint precise areas for improvement beyond general feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: An Intelligent GenAI-Powered Mock Interview Platform** \n",
    "\n",
    "This project introduces an innovative solution: an intelligent, AI-driven Mock Technical Interview Platform designed to provide realistic, interactive, and personalized interview practice. By harnessing the advanced capabilities of Google's Gemini models and the LangGraph framework, this platform offers a transformative approach to technical interview preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic Interview Simulation (LangGraph Agents): Employs LangGraph agents powered by Gemini to create a stateful, multi-turn conversational experience that mirrors a real technical interview, guiding candidates through problem-solving.\n",
    "* Interactive Problem Engagement (Gemini): Allows candidates to engage with coding problems through text, code input, and even visual explanations via whiteboard sketches interpreted by Gemini's image understanding capabilities.\n",
    "* Intelligent Guidance and Probing (Few-Shot Learning): Leverages few-shot learning within prompts to enable Gemini to provide contextually relevant hints, ask clarifying questions, and adapt its approach based on the candidate's responses, mimicking the nuanced interaction of a human interviewer.\n",
    "* Knowledge Retrieval for Questioning (Function Calling): Utilizes function calling to dynamically retrieve relevant interview questions from a database, ensuring a diverse and potentially tailored interview experience.\n",
    "* Comprehensive and Structured Performance Evaluation (Structured Output): Generates detailed, structured reports using Gemini's controlled generation capabilities, objectively assessing technical proficiency, problem-solving methodology, communication clarity, and code quality.\n",
    "* Personalized Learning and Skill Enhancement (Grounding): Employs Gemini's grounding capabilities (integrating with external knowledge sources) to analyze the interview performance and generate a targeted learning plan with relevant resources, directly addressing identified weaknesses.\n",
    "* Contextual Awareness and Long-Term Analysis (Long Context Window): Leverages Gemini's long context window to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the entire interview conversation, enabling nuanced feedback and holistic performance analysis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Innovation & Use Case Suitability** \n",
    "\n",
    "This project represents a significant step forward in technical interview preparation through its creative and impactful application of Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Novelty: It goes beyond simple Q&A by constructing a sophisticated, stateful interviewing agent capable of understanding multimodal input, providing adaptive guidance, and generating nuanced evaluations â€“ a level of interaction previously only achievable with human interviewers. The integration of whiteboard understanding directly into a technical interview simulation is particularly novel.\n",
    "* Impact: This platform has the potential to democratize access to high-quality interview practice, enabling a wider range of candidates to prepare effectively, reduce interview anxiety, and ultimately improve their chances of success in the competitive tech job market. Its scalability allows for widespread adoption and consistent, objective feedback.\n",
    "* GenAI Suitability: The project's core functionalities are exceptionally well-suited to the strengths of modern GenAI models like Gemini:\n",
    "* Natural Language Understanding and Generation: Crucial for engaging in a realistic dialogue, interpreting candidate responses, and formulating insightful questions and feedback.\n",
    "* Code Understanding and Generation: Essential for interacting with code snippets provided by the candidate and even generating follow-up questions based on the code.\n",
    "* Image Understanding: Enables the innovative feature of interpreting whiteboard sketches, a common element in real technical interviews.\n",
    "* Structured Output and Function Calling: Allows for the systematic retrieval of questions and the generation of organized and informative performance reports.\n",
    "* Agentic Capabilities (LangGraph): Necessary for orchestrating the complex, multi-step process of a technical interview, managing state, and directing the flow of the conversation.\n",
    "* Long Context Window: Enables the AI to maintain context throughout the interview for more accurate and relevant feedback.\n",
    "* Grounding: Facilitates the generation of personalized and actionable learning plans based on external knowledge.\n",
    "By seamlessly integrating these advanced GenAI capabilities, this project offers a powerful and innovative solution to the persistent challenges of technical interview preparation.\n",

    " ## 4. Core Logic: The Technical Interviewer Agent (LangGraph) \n",
    " \n",
    "The heart of this application is the agent built using LangGraph, designed to simulate the flow and logic of a technical interview. LangGraph allows us to define a state machine or graph where nodes represent processing steps (like invoking the LLM or tools) and edges represent the flow between these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.1. Agent Prompts** \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are crucial for guiding the Gemini model's behavior. We define several key prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT: This is the main prompt defining the AI's persona and core responsibilities.\n",
    "* Persona: A supportive technical interviewer from \"Mock Technologie Inc.\"\n",
    "* Goal: Evaluate the candidate's skills while guiding them through a problem.\n",
    "* Behavior: Ask probing questions, provide graduated hints (Level 1-3), encourage \"thinking out loud,\" confirm understanding.\n",
    "* Constraints: Must use tools to get questions, cannot make up questions, needs confirmation for starting/ending the interview.\n",
    "* Multi-Modal Handling: Explicit instructions on how to analyze and integrate information from whiteboard screenshots seamlessly into the conversation.\n",
    "* Few-Shot Examples: Includes example interactions to demonstrate desired behavior, especially regarding hint provision and whiteboard analysis.\n",
    "* WELCOME_MSG: The initial message the interviewer presents to the user.\n",
    "* CANDIDATE_EVALUATION_PROMPT: Used after the interview ends. It instructs a separate LLM call to analyze the full transcript and final code, evaluating the candidate based on specific criteria (Technical Competence, Problem-Solving, Communication). Crucially, it requests the output in a structured JSON format.\n",
    "* RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT: Used to generate the personalized learning plan. It provides context (interview question, evaluation summary, topics to learn) and instructs the LLM to use the Google Search tool (Grounding) to find relevant resources and synthesize recommendations, without explicitly listing URLs in the text (citations are handled automatically).\n",
    "* DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT: A specialized prompt used by the get_interview_transcript utility function. When a whiteboard image is present in the user's message, this prompt asks Gemini to describe the image's content and relevance to the ongoing conversation, making the transcript more comprehensive for the final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it solves the problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of Realistic Simulation: The INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT is the foundation of realism. It defines the AI's persona, its pedagogical goals (guiding, not just evaluating), its conversational style (probing questions, graduated hints), and how it should handle multi-modal input like whiteboard sketches. Few-shot examples within the prompt explicitly train the AI on how to interact realistically. The WELCOME_MSG sets a professional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subjective/Delayed Feedback: The CANDIDATE_EVALUATION_PROMPT sets clear, predefined criteria for evaluation, making the feedback inherently less subjective than varied human opinions. It guides the LLM to focus on specific, observable behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty Identifying Weaknesses: The evaluation prompt specifically requests identification of strengths and weaknesses with evidence. The RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT guides the generation of a learning plan directly targeting these identified weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Few words about the following prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first iteration of this prompt was created using materials from the Internet about how to be a good technical interviewer. Then, step by step, I improved this prompt to make the model do what I wanted it to and behave more like a real technical interviewer. Here are a few things that needed to be made to make the model work properly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a line telling the model to ask the user for confirmation (confirmation used to invoke tools)\n",
    "* Accent on the fact, that the model should only take questions from the database (using tools).\n",
    "* While testing, the model could give some strange responses. Using a few examples (few-shot learning) helps mitigate these issues.\n",
    "* Nevertheless, I think there could be a lot more things to change/add to this prompt, but we need to test it more."

    "*   **Positive and Supportive Tone:**  Create a comfortable environment where the candidate feels encouraged to explore solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Interview Execution Guidance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Problem Definition Confirmation:** Ensure the candidate understands the problem statement completely. Ask them to reiterate the problem in their own words. \"So, just to confirm, can you please explain the problem and expected inputs/outputs back to me?\"\n",
    "*   **Clarifying Questions:** Encourage the candidate to ask clarifying questions before they start coding. \"What questions do you have about the requirements or constraints before we begin?\"\n",
    "*   **Observing and Listening:** Pay close attention to the candidate's thought process.\n",
    "*   **Prompting Explanation:**  Actively ask the candidate to \"think out loud.\" Use prompts like:\n",
    "    *   \"What are you thinking?\"\n",
    "    *   \"What's your next step?\"\n",
    "    *   \"Why did you choose that approach?\"\n",
    "    *   \"What are the potential trade-offs of this approach?\"\n",
    "*   **Code Implementation:** Ask the candidate to code his solution when he described it in words. If candidate first decided to try bruteforce approach, you should still ask him to code it.\n",
    "*   **Strategic Hint Provision:** Offer hints in a graduated manner:\n",
    "    *   **Level 1 (General):** \"Have you considered [data structure/algorithm]?\", \"What's the time complexity of your current approach?\", \"Are there any edge cases you haven't accounted for?\"\n",
    "    *   **Level 2 (Specific):** \"You could use a hash map to [solve specific sub-problem].\", \"Try using a two-pointer approach when [condition exists].\", \"What should happen if the input is null or empty?\"\n",
    "    *   **Level 3 (Code Snippet/Conceptual Reminder):** \"In [language], you could use [built-in function] to [achieve specific task].\" \"Remember that Depth First Search involves exploring as far as possible down each branch.\"  Use code snippets SPARINGLY and ONLY after exhausting other options. Focus on conceptual understanding, not direct code completion.\n",
    "*   **Redirecting if Necessary:**  If the candidate is completely stuck, gently redirect them to a different approach or a simpler sub-problem.  \"Perhaps we can focus on [simplified task] first, to get a better understanding of the core concept.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Interactions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example 1: Candidate is slightly stuck on approach*\n",
    "Candidate Response: \"I'm trying to think about how to find the pairs efficiently. Maybe sort the array first?\"\n",
    "Interviewer Output/Response: \"Sorting is an interesting idea. What would be the time complexity of sorting, and how would you use the sorted array to find the pair?\" (This is a Level 1 hint, guiding towards complexity and next steps without giving away hash maps yet).\n",

    "*Example 2: Candidate makes a small logic error in code*\n",
    "Candidate Response: \"Here's my code using the hash map.\"\n",

What happens in the first iteration when `i=0` and `nums[i]=3`? What gets checked in the hash map, and what gets added?\" (This is probing/guiding towards the specific error without explicitly stating it).\n",

    "Interviewer Output/Response: \"Okay, consider the order. Right now, you check if the complement (`target - nums[i]`) exists in the map *before* you add the current number (`nums[i]`) to the map. What if the complement *is* the current number you're processing, like in the `[3, 3]` target 6 example?\" (This is a Level 2 hint pointing more directly at the logic flaw).\n",

    "*   **Screenshot of the user whiteboard (optional):** (Optional candidate's whiteboard screenshot. On the whiteboard candidate can explain his thoughts more clearly).\n",
    "*   **Instruction:** If a whiteboard image is provided, you MUST analyze its content (diagrams, pseudocode, logic flow, data structures etc.). **Seamlessly integrate your understanding and interpretation of the whiteboard into your main conversational response.** Don't just mention the image exists; refer to *specifics* you observe in it. Use this visual context to:\n",
    "*   Confirm your understanding (\"Okay, seeing the diagram confirms you're planning to use a hash map...\").\n",

    "*   **Next Probing Question:** (Ask a question to encourage the candidate to elaborate on their approach, clarify their reasoning, or identify potential issues. This question might stem from your whiteboard analysis.)\n",
    "*   **Strategic Hint (if necessary):** (Provide a hint appropriate for the candidate's current situation, following the Level 1-3 progression. Only provide a hint if the candidate is clearly stuck and not making progress.)\n",
    "*   **Guiding Suggestion (if necessary):** (If the candidate needs a nudge, suggest a specific action they could take to move forward. E.g., \"Try writing a simple test case to verify your logic.\")\n",

    "* encode64_pil_image: Converts PIL Images (from Gradio Sketchpad) to base64 strings suitable for inclusion in Gemini API calls.\n",
    "* get_data_for_search: Extracts structured analysis and learning topics from the evaluation output to feed into the grounding prompt.\n",
    "* get_interview_transcript: Processes the message history (InterviewState['messages']), extracting text and code. If an image is present, it calls Gemini using DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT to get a text description and incorporates it, creating a comprehensive transcript for the final evaluation. This handles the long context aspect.\n",
    "* get_learning_resources: Implements the Grounding feature. It calls Gemini with the RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT, enables the Google Search tool (types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())), processes the response to extract the generated text and citation metadata, and formats it into a Markdown string with superscript citations and a reference list. Includes retry logic for robustness.\n",

Pydantic models (ListQuestionArgs, SelectQuestionArgs) define the expected arguments for some tools. These tools interact with the Pandas DataFrame (df) loaded earlier or manipulate the interview state.\n",

    "* ToolNode: A LangGraph node specifically designed to execute the function calls requested by the LLM.\n",
    "* Custom Tool Handling: Specific tools (select_question, end_interview) require custom nodes (question_selection_node, finish_interview_node) to manipulate the InterviewState (e.g., update the current question, set the finished flag) based on the tool's execution, rather than just returning a simple text result.\n",

    " ## 5. Showcasing GenAI Capabilities\n",
    " \n",
    "This project explicitly demonstrates several powerful Generative AI features available through the Gemini API and LangChain/LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function Calling: The interviewer agent uses tools (list_questions, select_question, get_random_problem, end_interview, etc.) defined with the @tool decorator. The LLM (llm_with_tools) decides when to call these functions based on the conversation and system prompt, generating the required arguments. This allows the agent to interact with the external question database and control the interview flow (e.g., ending the interview). The ToolNode and custom tool nodes handle the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Structured Output: The create_report_node leverages Gemini's ability to generate JSON output conforming to a predefined schema. By defining Pydantic models (EvaluationOutput, etc.) and specifying them in the generate_content call (response_schema), we ensure the evaluation report is consistently structured, making it easy to parse and format using the Jinja2 template (REPORT_TEMPLATE).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Few-Shot Learning: The INTERVIEWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT includes explicit examples of interactions (e.g., how to provide hints, how to respond to whiteboard input). This provides the LLM with concrete examples of the desired behavior, improving its ability to follow instructions and adopt the correct persona and interaction style.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image Understanding (Multimodality): The application accepts whiteboard sketches via the Gradio Sketchpad. The chat_interface_update function encodes the PIL image to base64. The get_interview_transcript function then incorporates this image data when creating the full transcript passed to the evaluation model. It uses a Gemini Vision model via DESCRIBE_IMAGE_PROMPT to generate a textual description of the image, integrating visual information into the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agents (LangGraph): The entire interviewer is built as a stateful agent using LangGraph. It maintains the conversation state (InterviewState), transitions between different processing steps (nodes like chatbot, tools, create_report), and makes decisions based on LLM outputs and tool results (conditional edges via maybe_route_to_tools). This enables the complex, multi-turn, and tool-using behavior required for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long Context Window: The agent handles potentially long interview conversations. The InterviewState accumulates all messages. The get_interview_transcript function processes this entire history, and the create_report_node passes the full transcript to the evaluation model, allowing it to consider the entire interaction when generating the assessment. Gemini's long context capabilities are essential here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grounding (Gemini with Google Search): The get_learning_resources function implements grounding. It calls Gemini with a specific prompt (RESOURCES_SEARCH_PROMPT) and enables the GoogleSearch tool. Gemini uses search results to generate a grounded learning plan based on the evaluation feedback and identified topics, ensuring the recommendations are relevant and based on real-world information. The system automatically handles citations for the sources used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Gradio User Interface \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the Mock Interviewer interactive, I build a web interface using Gradio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.1. Interaction Logic** \n",
    "\n",
    "* State Management (gr.State): A Gradio State object (chat_state) holds the current InterviewState (messages, question, code, finished flag) and UI-related flags (code_changed, image_changed) between interactions.\n",
    "* Initialization (init_chat): When the Gradio app loads, this function runs the LangGraph with an empty initial state to get the welcome message from the chatbot node and sets up the initial UI components.\n",
    "* Update Loop (chat_interface_update): This is the core function triggered by the \"Send Message\" button.\n",
    "    * It retrieves the current state and user inputs (text, code, image).\n",
    "    * It checks if the interview is already marked as finished.\n",
    "    * It packages the user's input (text, code, image description) into a HumanMessage. Special handling ensures code and images are included only if they've changed since the last turn. Images are base64 encoded.\n",
    "    * It appends the new HumanMessage to the state's message list.\n",
    "    * It invokes the interviewer_graph with the updated state.\n",
    "    * It processes the new_state returned by the graph:\n",
    "        * Extracts the latest AI message to display.\n",
    "        * Updates the problem description and code editor content if they changed.\n",
    "        * Checks the finished flag in the new state.\n",
    "        * Updates the chat_state for the next turn.\n",
    "        * Updates the visibility of the Download button based on the finished flag.\n",
    "        * Returns updates for all relevant Gradio components.\n",
    "* Input Change Handlers: mark_code_as_changed and mark_image_as_changed are triggered by changes in the gr.Code and gr.Sketchpad inputs, respectively. They update the corresponding data and flags in the chat_state without triggering a full graph invocation, ensuring that code/image changes are only sent when the user explicitly clicks \"Send Message\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it solves the problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhances Realism : Provides interactive text, code, and whiteboard inputs, mimicking real interview tools. The turn-by-turn interface simulates a dynamic, stateful conversation.\n",
    "* Improves Accessibility & Scalability : As a web application, it offers practice anytime, anywhere, connecting users to the scalable AI backend without needing human interviewer availability or specialized software.\n",
    "* Ensures Immediate & Actionable Feedback: Delivers the standardized evaluation report via an immediate download button upon interview completion. This report clearly highlights specific weaknesses and provides targeted learning resources, enabling focused improvement."

    "\n",
    "Conclusion \n",
    "* This project successfully demonstrates the creation of a sophisticated, AI-powered Mock Technical Interviewer using Google Gemini and LangGraph. By integrating features like stateful agentic behavior, function calling, structured output, multimodal input (text, code, image), and grounded recommendations, it provides a valuable and interactive tool for developers preparing for technical interviews. The detailed evaluation report and personalized learning plan offer actionable feedback to help users identify strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Future Work\n",
    "* More Question Types: Expand the data.json to include system design, behavioral questions, or questions for different roles/levels.\n",
    "* Voice Interaction: Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech for a more natural conversational experience.\n",
    "* Code Execution & Testing: Allow the agent to actually run the candidate's code against test cases and provide feedback on correctness and performance.\n",
    "* More Sophisticated Evaluation: Fine-tune the evaluation prompt or use multiple LLM calls for deeper analysis of specific aspects (e.g., code quality metrics, complexity analysis).\n",
    "* Persistence: Allow users to save and resume interview sessions.\n",
    "* Different Interviewer Personas: Offer options for different interviewer styles (e.g., more challenging, more collaborative)."
